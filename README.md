# Mozilla Developer Network: TODO List
We've been tasked with creating a proof-of-concept in React â€“ an app that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks they want to work on, and also mark tasks as complete without deleting them. This article: [MDN: React TODO App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning) will walk you through the basic structure and styling of such an application, ready for individual component definition and interactivity.

# React + Vite

This was started with Vite to scaffold a new React App which provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
