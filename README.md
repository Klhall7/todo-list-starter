# TODO List With Mozilla Developer Network
We've been tasked with creating a proof-of-concept in Reactâ€“ an app that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks they want to work on, and also mark tasks as complete without deleting them.  This article: [MDN: React TODO App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning) will walk you through the basic structure and styling of such an application, ready for individual component definition and interactivity.
